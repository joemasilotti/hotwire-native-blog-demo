## Initial setup

An installation script is included with the repository that will get the application set up.

```bash

```

## Development

Start the server.

```bash
bin/rails server
```

## Seeds

Seeding the database, either via `bin/rails db:seed` or during `bin/setup`, creates a few blog posts.
